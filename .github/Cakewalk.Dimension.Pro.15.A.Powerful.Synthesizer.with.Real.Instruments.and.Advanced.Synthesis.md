Dimension Pro 15 allows you to mix and layer up to four stereo parts per program, each with its own sample or multisample, envelope generators, LFOs, filters and effects. You can also use the vector mixer to morph between the parts in real time, creating dynamic and expressive sounds. Dimension Pro 15 supports Mac formats (AU, RTAS and VSTi) and Windows formats (DXi and VSTi), and can be used as a standalone instrument or as a plug-in in your favorite host.
 
If you are looking for a versatile and powerful synthesizer that can handle any genre and style of music, you should check out Cakewalk Dimension Pro 15. You can download it from the official website or use the keygen provided by AudioZ to activate it. However, we recommend that you purchase the product from Cakewalk to support the developers and get access to updates and support.
  
In this section, we will explore some of the features and functions of Dimension Pro 15 in more detail. First, let's take a look at the user interface and how to navigate it. The user interface consists of four main areas: the program area, the element area, the modulation area and the effects area.
 
- The program area shows the name of the current program and allows you to load and save programs, as well as access the browser and the options menu. You can also drag and drop MIDI files from your host or your computer into the program area to trigger the grooves included in the sound library.
- The element area shows the name of the sample or multisample used by each of the four elements in the program. You can click on the sample name to load a different sample or drag and drop your own samples from your host or your computer. You can also edit the general parameters of each element, such as pitch, pan, level, key range, velocity range and output routing. You can enable or disable each element by clicking on the E buttons at the top left corner of the element area.
- The modulation area shows the graphical envelope generators and LFOs for each element. You can edit the shape and parameters of each envelope and LFO by clicking and dragging on the nodes and handles. You can also assign modulation sources and destinations by clicking on the modulation matrix slots at the bottom of the modulation area.
- The effects area shows the multi-stage effects sections for each element and for the global output. You can choose from a variety of effects types, such as EQ, compressor, chorus, flanger, phaser, delay and reverb. You can also adjust the parameters of each effect by clicking and dragging on the knobs and sliders.

Now that you have a basic understanding of how to use Dimension Pro 15, let's see how you can create your own sounds with it. One of the easiest ways to start is to browse through the presets and find one that suits your needs. You can use the browser to filter the presets by category, subcategory and author. You can also use the search function to find presets by name or keyword. Once you have loaded a preset, you can tweak it to your liking by changing the samples, parameters, modulation and effects of each element. You can also mix and match elements from different presets by loading them individually from the browser.
 
Another way to create your own sounds with Dimension Pro 15 is to start from scratch and build your own program from scratch. You can do this by loading an empty program from the browser or by clearing an existing program. Then you can load your own samples or choose from the sound library for each element. You can also use the waveguide generator to create plucked-string sounds or use single-cycle wavetables for synth sounds. You can then shape and modulate your sounds with envelopes, LFOs, filters and effects. You can also use the vector mixer to blend between elements in real time.
 
As you can see, Dimension Pro 15 is a powerful synthesizer that offers a lot of flexibility and creativity for sound design. Whether you are looking for realistic acoustic instruments, synthetic sounds or hybrid combinations, Dimension Pro 15 can deliver them with high quality and ease of use.
